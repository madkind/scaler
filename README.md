2024.11.14 
- [2h] Init backend project. I would challenge you asking for an unreleased version of django, but I suppose you challenge me!
2024.11.18-19
- [~11h] On plane, in flight wifi. Approx half of 22h journey from Indonesia to Italy. Suboptimal working conditions, but not impossible. I do my best to deliver a working backend.


I am striving to demonstrate my skills in a quick manner. Best practices I am not implementing, however I am aware of:
- Slim docker images with multi stage build
- indexed full text search, maybe with vector extension of PG
- consumer driven contract testing ?!
- separate file for dev requirements
- Authentication (employee model could extend AbstractUser)
- Deal with admin ui


Unfortunately I do not have the time or the gear to work on the frontend before deadline.
